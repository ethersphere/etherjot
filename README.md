# Etherjot Importer

Test tes test
Etherjot is a CLI utility to import Hugo and Jekyll blogs onto the Swarm network and [Etherjot Web](https://github.com/ethersphere/etherjot-web). Most of the implementation is available in the core library [Libetherjot](https://github.com/ethersphere/libetherjot).

## Swarm network

Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of Bee nodes that collectively provide censorship resistant decentralised storage and communication services.

## Usage

Etherjot requires a local Bee node. The easiest way to fire up a node is to install [Swarm Desktop](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-desktop) which you can download from `https://desktop.ethswarm.org`.

```
npm install --global etherjot
```

Step into the directory of a Hugo and Jekyll blog

```
etherjot import
```
